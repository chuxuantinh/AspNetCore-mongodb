# Part 5, work with a database in an ASP.NET Core MVC app

::: moniker range=">= aspnetcore-3.0"

The `MvcMovieContext` object handles the task of connecting to the database and mapping `Movie` objects to database records. The database context is registered with the [Dependency Injection](xref:fundamentals/dependency-injection) container in the `ConfigureServices` method in the *Startup.cs* file:

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

[!code-csharp[](~/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc/sample/MvcMovie3/Startup.cs?name=snippet_ConfigureServices&highlight=5-6)]

The ASP.NET Core [Configuration](xref:fundamentals/configuration/index) system reads the `ConnectionString`. For local development, it gets the connection string from the *appsettings.json* file:

[!code-json[](start-mvc/sample/MvcMovie/appsettings.json?highlight=2&range=8-10)]

# [Visual Studio Code / Visual Studio for Mac](#tab/visual-studio-code+visual-studio-mac)

[!code-csharp[](~/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc/sample/MvcMovie3/Startup.cs?name=snippet_UseSqlite&highlight=5-6)]

The ASP.NET Core [Configuration](xref:fundamentals/configuration/index) system reads the `ConnectionString`. For local development, it gets the connection string from the *appsettings.json* file:

[!code-json[](~/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc/sample/MvcMovie22/appsettingsSQLite.json?highlight=2&range=8-10)]

---

When the app is deployed to a test or production server, an environment variable can be used to set the connection string to a production SQL Server. See [Configuration](xref:fundamentals/configuration/index) for more information.

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

## SQL Server Express LocalDB

LocalDB is a lightweight version of the SQL Server Express Database Engine that's targeted for program development. LocalDB starts on demand and runs in user mode, so there's no complex configuration. By default, LocalDB database creates *.mdf* files in the *C:/Users/{user}* directory.

* From the **View** menu, open **SQL Server Object Explorer** (SSOX).

* Right click on the `Movie` table **> View Designer**

  ![Contextual menu open on Movie table](working-with-sql/_static/design.png)

Note the key icon next to `ID`. By default, EF will make a property named `ID` the primary key.

* Right click on the `Movie` table **> View Data**

## Seed the database

Create a new class named `SeedData` in the *Models* folder. Replace the generated code with the following:

[!code-csharp[](~/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc/sample/MvcMovie3/Models/SeedData.cs?name=snippet_1)]

If there are any movies in the DB, the seed initializer returns and no movies are added.

```csharp
if (context.Movie.Any())
{
    return;   // DB has been seeded.
}
```

<a name="si"></a>

### Add the seed initializer

Replace the contents of *Program.cs* with the following code:

[!code-csharp[](~/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc/sample/MvcMovie3/Program.cs)]

Test the app

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

* Delete all the records in the DB. You can do this with the delete links in the browser or from SSOX.
* Force the app to initialize (call the methods in the `Startup` class) so the seed method runs. To force initialization, IIS Express must be stopped and restarted. You can do this with any of the following approaches:

  * Right click the IIS Express system tray icon in the notification area and tap **Exit** or **Stop Site**

    ![IIS Express system tray icon](working-with-sql/_static/iisExIcon.png)

    ![Contextual menu](working-with-sql/_static/stopIIS.png)

    * If you were running VS in non-debug mode, press F5 to run in debug mode
    * If you were running VS in debug mode, stop the debugger and press F5

# [Visual Studio Code / Visual Studio for Mac](#tab/visual-studio-code+visual-studio-mac)

Delete all the records in the DB (So the seed method will run). Stop and start the app to seed the database.

---

The app shows the seeded data.
