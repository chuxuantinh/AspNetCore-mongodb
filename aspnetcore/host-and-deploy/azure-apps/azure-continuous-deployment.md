# Continuous deployment to Azure with Visual Studio and Git with ASP.NET Core

By [Erik Reitan](https://github.com/Erikre)

[!INCLUDE [Azure App Service Preview Notice](../../includes/azure-apps-preview-notice.md)]

This tutorial shows how to create an ASP.NET Core web app using Visual Studio and deploy it from Visual Studio to Azure App Service using continuous deployment.

See also [Create your first pipeline with Azure Pipelines](/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started-yaml), which shows how to configure a continuous delivery (CD) workflow for [Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/app-service-web-overview) using Azure DevOps Services. Azure Pipelines (an Azure DevOps Services service) simplifies setting up a robust deployment pipeline to publish updates for apps hosted in Azure App Service. The pipeline can be configured from the Azure portal to build, run tests, deploy to a staging slot, and then deploy to production.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes the following software is installed:

* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)
* [!INCLUDE [](~/includes/net-core-sdk-download-link.md)]
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for Windows

## Create an ASP.NET Core web app

1. Start Visual Studio.

1. From the **File** menu, select **New** > **Project**.

1. Select the **ASP.NET Core Web Application** project template. It appears under **Installed** > **Templates** > **Visual C#** > **.NET Core**. Name the project `SampleWebAppDemo`. Select the **Create new Git repository** option and click **OK**.

   ![New Project dialog](azure-continuous-deployment/_static/01-new-project.png)

1. In the **New ASP.NET Core Project** dialog, select the ASP.NET Core **Empty** template, then click **OK**.

   ![New ASP.NET Core Project dialog](azure-continuous-deployment/_static/02-web-site-template.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The most recent release of .NET Core is 2.0.

### Running the web app locally

1. Once Visual Studio finishes creating the app, run the app by selecting **Debug** > **Start Debugging**. As an alternative, press **F5**.

   It may take time to initialize Visual Studio and the new app. Once it's complete, the browser shows the running app.

   ![Browser window showing running application that displays 'Hello World!'](azure-continuous-deployment/_static/04-browser-runapp.png)

1. After reviewing the running Web app, close the browser and select the "Stop Debugging" icon in the toolbar of Visual Studio to stop the app.

## Create a web app in the Azure Portal

The following steps create a web app in the Azure Portal:

1. Log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Select **NEW** at the top left of the portal interface.

1. Select **Web + Mobile** > **Web App**.

   ![Microsoft Azure Portal: New button: Web + Mobile under Marketplace: Web App button under Featured Apps](azure-continuous-deployment/_static/05-azure-newwebapp.png)

1. In the **Web App** blade, enter a unique value for the **App Service Name**.

   ![Web App blade](azure-continuous-deployment/_static/06-azure-newappblade.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **App Service Name** name must be unique. The portal enforces this rule when the name is provided. If providing a different value, substitute that value for each occurrence of **SampleWebAppDemo** in this tutorial.

   Also in the **Web App** blade, select an existing **App Service Plan/Location** or create a new one. If creating a new plan, select the pricing tier, location, and other options. For more information on App Service plans, see [Azure App Service plans in-depth overview](/azure/app-service/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview).

1. Select **Create**. Azure will provision and start the web app.

   ![Azure Portal: Sample Web App Demo 01 Essentials blade](azure-continuous-deployment/_static/07-azure-webappblade.png)

## Enable Git publishing for the new web app

Git is a distributed version control system that can be used to deploy an Azure App Service web app. Web app code is stored in a local Git repository, and the code is deployed to Azure by pushing to a remote repository.

1. Log into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Select **App Services** to view a list of the app services associated with the Azure subscription.

1. Select the web app created in the previous section of this tutorial.

1. In the **Deployment** blade, select **Deployment options** > **Choose Source** > **Local Git Repository**.

   ![Settings blade: Deployment source blade: Choose source blade](azure-continuous-deployment/_static/deployment-options.png)

1. Select **OK**.

1. If deployment credentials for publishing a web app or other App Service app haven't previously been set up, set them up now:

   * Select **Settings** > **Deployment credentials**. The **Set deployment credentials** blade is displayed.
   * Create a user name and password. Save the password for later use when setting up Git.
   * Select **Save**.

1. In the **Web App** blade, select **Settings** > **Properties**. The URL of the remote Git repository to deploy to is shown under **GIT URL**.

1. Copy the **GIT URL** value for later use in the tutorial.

   ![Azure Portal: application Properties blade](azure-continuous-deployment/_static/09-azure-giturl.png)

## Publish the web app to Azure App Service

In this section, create a local Git repository using Visual Studio and push from that repository to Azure to deploy the web app. The steps involved include the following:

* Add the remote repository setting using the GIT URL value, so the local repository can be deployed to Azure.
* Commit project changes.
* Push project changes from the local repository to the remote repository on Azure.

1. In **Solution Explorer** right-click **Solution 'SampleWebAppDemo'** and select **Commit**. The **Team Explorer** is displayed.

   ![Team Explorer Connect tab](azure-continuous-deployment/_static/10-team-explorer.png)

1. In **Team Explorer**, select the **Home** (home icon) > **Settings** > **Repository Settings**.

1. In the **Remotes** section of the **Repository Settings**, select **Add**. The **Add Remote** dialog box is displayed.

1. Set the **Name** of the remote to **Azure-SampleApp**.

1. Set the value for **Fetch** to the **Git URL** that copied from Azure earlier in this tutorial. Note that this is the URL that ends with **.git**.

   ![Edit Remote dialog](azure-continuous-deployment/_static/11-add-remote.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > As an alternative, specify the remote repository from the **Command Window** by opening the **Command Window**, changing to the project directory, and entering the command. Example:
   >
   > `git remote add Azure-SampleApp https://me@sampleapp.scm.azurewebsites.net:443/SampleApp.git`

1. Select the **Home** (home icon) > **Settings** > **Global Settings**. Confirm that the name and email address are set. Select **Update** if required.

1. Select **Home** > **Changes** to return to the **Changes** view.

1. Enter a commit message, such as **Initial Push #1** and select **Commit**. This action creates a *commit* locally.

   ![Team Explorer Connect tab](azure-continuous-deployment/_static/12-initial-commit.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > As an alternative, commit changes from the **Command Window** by opening the **Command Window**, changing to the project directory, and entering the git commands. Example:
   >
   > `git add .`
   >
   > `git commit -am "Initial Push #1"`

1. Select **Home** > **Sync** > **Actions** > **Open Command Prompt**. The command prompt opens to the project directory.

1. Enter the following command in the command window:

   `git push -u Azure-SampleApp main`

1. Enter the Azure **deployment credentials** password created earlier in Azure.

   This command starts the process of pushing the local project files to Azure. The output from the above command ends with a message that the deployment was successful.

   ```
   remote: Finished successfully.
   remote: Running post deployment command(s)...
   remote: Deployment successful.
   To https://username@samplewebappdemo01.scm.azurewebsites.net:443/SampleWebAppDemo01.git
   * [new branch]      main -> main
   Branch main set up to track remote branch main from Azure-SampleApp.
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > If collaboration on the project is required, consider pushing to [GitHub](https://github.com) before pushing to Azure.
 
### Verify the Active Deployment

Verify that the web app transfer from the local environment to Azure is successful.

In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), select the web app. Select **Deployment** > **Deployment options**.

![Azure Portal: Settings blade: Deployments blade showing successful deployment](azure-continuous-deployment/_static/13-verify-deployment.png)

## Run the app in Azure

Now that the web app is deployed to Azure, run the app.

This can be accomplished in two ways:

* In the Azure Portal, locate the web app blade for the web app. Select **Browse** to view the app in the default browser.
* Open a browser and enter the URL for the web app. Example: `http://SampleWebAppDemo.azurewebsites.net`

## Update the web app and republish

After making changes to the local code, republish:

1. In **Solution Explorer** of Visual Studio, open the *Startup.cs* file.

1. In the `Configure` method, modify the `Response.WriteAsync` method so that it appears as follows:

   ```csharp
   await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello World! Deploy to Azure.");
   ```

1. Save the changes to *Startup.cs*.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click **Solution 'SampleWebAppDemo'** and select **Commit**. The **Team Explorer** is displayed.

1. Enter a commit message, such as `Update #2`.

1. Press the **Commit** button to commit the project changes.

1. Select **Home** > **Sync** > **Actions** > **Push**.

> [!NOTE]
> As an alternative, push the changes from the **Command Window** by opening the **Command Window**, changing to the project directory, and entering a git command. Example:
> 
> `git push -u Azure-SampleApp main`

## View the updated web app in Azure

View the updated web app by selecting **Browse** from the web app blade in the Azure Portal or by opening a browser and entering the URL for the web app. Example: `http://SampleWebAppDemo.azurewebsites.net`
