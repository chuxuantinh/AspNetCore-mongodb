# Twitter external sign-in setup with ASP.NET Core

By [Valeriy Novytskyy](https://github.com/01binary) and [Rick Anderson](https://twitter.com/RickAndMSFT)

This sample shows how to enable users to [sign in with their Twitter account](https://dev.twitter.com/web/sign-in/desktop-browser) using a sample ASP.NET Core 3.0 project created on the [previous page](xref:security/authentication/social/index).

## Create the app in Twitter

* Add the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Twitter](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Twitter/3.0.0) NuGet package to the project.

* Navigate to [https://apps.twitter.com/](https://apps.twitter.com/) and sign in. If you don't already have a Twitter account, use the **[Sign up now](https://twitter.com/signup)** link to create one.

* Select **Create an app**. Fill out the **App name**, **Application description** and public **Website** URI (this can be temporary until you register the domain name):

* Check the box next to **Enable Sign in with Twitter**

* Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity requires users to have an email address by default. Go to the **Permissions** tab, click the **Edit** button and check the box next to **Request email address from users**.

* Enter your development URI with `/signin-twitter` appended into the **Callback URLs** field (for example: `https://webapp128.azurewebsites.net/signin-twitter`). The Twitter authentication scheme configured later in this sample will automatically handle requests at `/signin-twitter` route to implement the OAuth flow.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The URI segment `/signin-twitter` is set as the default callback of the Twitter authentication provider. You can change the default callback URI while configuring the Twitter authentication middleware via the inherited [RemoteAuthenticationOptions.CallbackPath](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.remoteauthenticationoptions.callbackpath) property of the [TwitterOptions](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.twitter.twitteroptions) class.

* Fill out the rest of the form and select **Create**. New application details are displayed:

## Store the Twitter consumer API key and secret

Store sensitive settings such as the Twitter consumer API key and secret with [Secret Manager](xref:security/app-secrets). For this sample, use the following steps:

1. Initialize the project for secret storage per the instructions at [Enable secret storage](xref:security/app-secrets#enable-secret-storage).
1. Store the sensitive settings in the local secret store with the secrets keys `Authentication:Twitter:ConsumerKey` and `Authentication:Twitter:ConsumerSecret`:

    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet user-secrets set "Authentication:Twitter:ConsumerAPIKey" "<consumer-api-key>"
    dotnet user-secrets set "Authentication:Twitter:ConsumerSecret" "<consumer-secret>"
    ```

These tokens can be found on the **Keys and Access Tokens** tab after creating a new Twitter application:

## Configure Twitter Authentication

Add the Twitter service in the `ConfigureServices` method in *Startup.cs* file:

[!code-csharp[](~/security/authentication/social/social-code/3.x/StartupTwitter3x.cs?name=snippet&highlight=10-15)]

[!INCLUDE [default settings configuration](includes/default-settings.md)]

[!INCLUDE[](includes/chain-auth-providers.md)]

See the [TwitterOptions](/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.builder.twitteroptions) API reference for more information on configuration options supported by Twitter authentication. This can be used to request different information about the user.

## Sign in with Twitter

Run the app and select **Log in**. An option to sign in with Twitter appears:

Clicking on **Twitter** redirects to Twitter for authentication:

After entering your Twitter credentials, you are redirected back to the web site where you can set your email.

You are now logged in using your Twitter credentials:

<!-- 
### React to cancel Authorize External sign-in
Twitter doesn't support AccessDeniedPath
Rather in the twitter setup, you can provide an External sign-in homepage. The external sign-in homepage doesn't support localhost. Tested with https://cors3.azurewebsites.net/ and that works.
-->

## Troubleshooting

* **ASP.NET Core 2.x only:** If Identity isn't configured by calling `services.AddIdentity` in `ConfigureServices`, attempting to authenticate will result in *ArgumentException: The 'SignInScheme' option must be provided*. The project template used in this sample ensures that this is done.
* If the site database has not been created by applying the initial migration, you will get *A database operation failed while processing the request* error. Tap **Apply Migrations** to create the database and refresh to continue past the error.

## Next steps

* This article showed how you can authenticate with Twitter. You can follow a similar approach to authenticate with other providers listed on the [previous page](xref:security/authentication/social/index).

* Once you publish your web site to Azure web app, you should reset the `ConsumerSecret` in the Twitter developer portal.

* Set the `Authentication:Twitter:ConsumerKey` and `Authentication:Twitter:ConsumerSecret` as application settings in the Azure portal. The configuration system is set up to read keys from environment variables.
